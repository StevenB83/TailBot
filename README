Simple IRC Tailbot written for a friend.

Modified by sully to suit my particular purposes:
 - takes the prefix of log file names and switches files when a new
   file with that prefix is created
 - Reads the file in as utf-16 and emits it as utf-8
 - Filters out some lines and removes timestamps based on a hardcoded
   pattern
I may generalize some of this more if I care.
